# Simple C++ pathfinding tool

Based on a task in which there is a network, where each vertex has up to four neighbours in a lattice pattern, and the distance between each vertex is constant. Some verteices cannot be visited, and the problem posed is to find the shortest path between the start point and the end point, within a given path length if possible, and return the path taken
